# Privacy Policy

We believe in keeping things simple and respecting your privacy. This game is designed to be lightweight and privacy-focused.
---
> **TL;DR**: We only store your display name and game settings in your browser. Nothing else. No tracking, no data collection, no nonsense.

## What We Store

All data is stored **locally** in your browser:
- Display name
- Game settings (controls, graphics, audio preferences)
- Avatar customization
- Window positions and preferences

That's it! No accounts, no tracking, no analytics.

## How We Use Data

The only data we store is used to:
- Remember your display name for chat
- Save your game preferences
- Keep your avatar customization
- Remember your window layouts

All of this stays in your browser's localStorage. We don't have access to it, and it never leaves your device.

## Data Collection

We don't collect any:
- Personal information
- Email addresses
- IP addresses
- Location data
- Usage statistics
- Cookies
- Analytics data

## Your Data Control

You can:
- Clear your game data by clearing your browser data
- Play in private/incognito mode to prevent data storage
- Delete your display name and settings at any time
- Export/import your settings (coming soon)

## Third Parties

We don't:
- Share data with anyone (because we don't collect any!)
- Use third-party services
- Include tracking scripts
- Have any external dependencies that collect data

## Updates

If we ever change how we handle data (we probably won't), we'll update this policy and let you know in the game.
